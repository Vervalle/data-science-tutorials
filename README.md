# data-science-tutorials

This repository contains jupyter-notebooks to accompany the tutorials for our data science lectures. The following topics are covered (each within a separate folder).

1. Dataset Visualization (Boston Housing minus the linear regression;
also other datasets like Flower, MNIST-digits, 20newsgroups) working/visualizing one dataset (incl. Matplotlib; .describe attribute; box-plot, min-max-normilization; boston housing; linear reg c/o dsP)
2. Clustering
3. Association Rule Learning (dataset yet to be determined; preferably from scikit learn)
4. Regression (linear regression from Boston Housing and Car Prices)
5. Classification with Decision Trees (start with small 5-line dataset)
6. Neural Networks (use keras.io to build a neural network for
MNIST-digit classification) keras (for MNIST class); OPT gensim (for
	word2vec; pick dataset from tensorflow); then auto-encoder for
	representatino learning
7. MapReduce
