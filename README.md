# data-science-tutorials

This repository containsn jupyter-notebooks to accompany the tutorials for our data science lectures. The following topics are covered (each within a separate folder).

1. Dataset Visualization (Boston Housing minus the linear regression; also other datasets like Flower, MNIST-digits, 20newsgroups)
2. Clustering
3. Association Rule Learning (dataset yet to be determined; preferably from scikit learn)
4. Regression (linear regression from Boston Housing and Car Prices)
5. Classification with Decision Trees (start with small 5-line dataset)
6. Neural Networks (use keras.io to build a neural network for MNIST-digit classification)
7. MapReduce
